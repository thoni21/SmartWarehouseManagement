<h1>SmartWarehouseManagement</h1>
<b>SmartWarehouseManagement</b> is a warehouse management web app with an ASP.NET backend, 
a React frontend, and PostgreSQL as the database. The app allows authenticated users to add items to the warehouse, 
create and view orders, and create shipments for said orders.

The app was made as a small side project to try developing with a React frontend, with no intention of being more than a project to show recruiters.
